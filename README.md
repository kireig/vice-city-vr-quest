# Vice City VR for Meta Quest — source build kit

> **NO APK IS PROVIDED. THIS IS A SOURCE-BUILD RELEASE.**
>
> On Windows, connect the Quest and double-click **`BUILD_AND_INSTALL.bat`**.
> On Linux, connect the Quest and run **`./BUILD_AND_INSTALL.sh`**.
> The wizard obtains portable Git, JDK 21, the Android command-line SDK,
> the exact reVC source, assembles the port, builds your personal APK, installs
> it without clearing existing data, and can copy only the required folders
> from your legally owned Vice City installation.
> Missing build tools and SDK packages are downloaded from their official
> sources and verified against pinned SHA256 hashes automatically. Google SDK
> licenses are still shown for the user to accept.
> If an older installation has an incompatible signing key, the wizard warns
> that replacing it can erase saves/game data and uninstalls it only after an
> explicit `Y` confirmation. It validates the supplied Vice City PC folder
> before removal so the required game data can be restored afterward.
> You may also download only **`BUILD_AND_INSTALL.bat`** (Windows) or
> **`BUILD_AND_INSTALL.sh`** (Linux). If the rest of the
> source kit is not beside it, the wrapper downloads and extracts the complete
> public repository automatically.
>
> Run the wrapper (`.bat` on Windows, `.sh` on Linux), not the internal
> wizard file. The window remains open on
> errors and writes `%TEMP%\ViceCityVR-Build-And-Install.log` (Windows) or
> `$TMPDIR/ViceCityVR-Build-And-Install.log` (Linux); send that log

This repository contains the original Quest/OpenXR port layer, Vulkan backend
changes, build scripts and reVC patch files needed to build Vice City VR for a
Meta Quest headset.

Current source-kit version: **v0.5.5.1 alpha**.

This maintenance release removes unnecessary rendering and settings-file work
when optional effects are disabled, and fixes mip-worker cancellation and upload
bursts. Existing graphics preferences are preserved. See [performance notes](PERFORMANCE.md)
for the fixes and how to compare against 0.5.2 after a full restart.

It intentionally contains **no APK, complete reVC source tree, original game
files, saves, logs or third-party Modern model packs**. Every user builds their
own APK and supplies data from a legally owned PC copy of GTA Vice City.

## What is included

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `overlay/` | New Android, OpenXR, Quest VR and tooling files |
| `patches/` | Changes applied to a user-supplied reVC checkout |
| `librw/` | MIT-licensed librw fork with the Quest Vulkan backend |
| `tools/` | Windows and Unix source-assembly scripts |

Modified upstream reVC files are distributed as patches, not as a second copy
of the reVC repository. The only bundled art is the credited MIT-licensed VR
hand asset under `overlay/gamefiles/models/vrhands/`.

## Required external source

The exact patch base comes from the public upstream reVC project:

<https://github.com/mrxenginner/reVC>

The tested public `miami` commit is
`026cd10f3fdbd92c089830e5067c4457c53c1b51`. The assembly scripts never modify
that checkout: they copy it to a new directory, apply the public-base
compatibility patch followed by this project's patches, and add Quest-only
files. No private repository is required or referenced.

Complete prerequisites and copy-paste commands are in
[BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).

For most Windows users, the recommended route is the guided
[`BUILD_AND_INSTALL.bat`](BUILD_AND_INSTALL.bat) wizard (Linux:
[`BUILD_AND_INSTALL.sh`](BUILD_AND_INSTALL.sh)) instead of entering
those commands manually.

If the OPTIONS menus show entries like `FET_GFX missing` or `FED_AAS missing`
instead of labels, the installation predates the wizard copying the port's
replacement text and frontend files.
[`REPAIR_GAME_FILES.bat`](REPAIR_GAME_FILES.bat) (Windows) or
[`REPAIR_GAME_FILES.sh`](REPAIR_GAME_FILES.sh) (Linux) installs just those onto an
existing headset; saves, settings and models are left alone.

The source-only maintainer checks are in [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).

## Current Quest build

- Native arm64 Android application using OpenXR and Vulkan multiview.
- Room scale: the headset is the camera in the world, so walking, leaning
  and ducking in the play space move the player's viewpoint through Vice
  City rather than only turning it.
- Physical VR weapons, two-hand support, holsters and scoped aiming.
- Physical steering for cars and motorcycles, including model steering wheels.
- In-headset VR, calibration, cheats, traffic, graphics and model-set menus.
- Remappable controller buttons under `VR MENU > CONTROLS`: the face buttons,
  the grips and the stick clicks each pick the game action they trigger, with a
  SWAPPED HANDS layout that moves jump and enter/exit to the right controller.
- Stereo-safe building culling with an exact OFF fallback.
- Mip chains built at load for a game that shipped none. Vice City stores
  every world texture at a single level, so distant fences, signs and
  foliage were minified straight off the full-size image and crawled with
  every head movement. The port filters the missing levels on a worker
  thread, weighted by alpha so cut-out masks keep their colour. The
  player's own TXD files are never modified.
- Optional per-pixel dynamic lights: headlights, explosions, street lamps
  and neon applied to the world instead of only to peds and vehicles, with
  an air-glow mode that makes a source visible in the air and not only as
  its pool on the ground. Intensity, glow and light count are adjustable.
  Off by default -- it costs GPU on a lamp-dense block.
- Optional vehicle reflections. RenderWare drew env-map materials with a
  second textured pass this backend never had, so cars had none; what
  ships is screen-space, reprojecting the previous frame onto the bodywork
  over the model's own streak art. Strength, range and sampled resolution
  are adjustable. Off by default -- it is the most expensive option here.
- Modern water. The bay, the canals and the pool water keep Rockstar's own
  art and gain a wave field on top of it: a generated normal map scrolled
  as two layers, anchored in world coordinates so the swell stays put as
  the player moves. At a grazing angle Fresnel turns the surface into a
  mirror of the previous frame -- the same one the cars use -- so the
  skyline, the neon and the headlights land on the water; looking straight
  down it stays the original texture. The sun draws a glint across the
  ripples and the dynamic lights scatter sparks over them at night.
  Waves, speed, distortion, mirror strength, sky sheen, glint and sparks
  are separate sliders under EFFECTS > MODERN WATER. Off by default --
  it costs about what the vehicle reflection does -- and one integer
  test per water pixel while it is.
- Optional PS2 two-pass alpha rule for masked geometry, which removes the
  faint outline a railing or fence carves out of the wall behind it. Off
  by default: it draws every masked mesh twice, and a Vice City street is
  mostly railings, fences and foliage.
- Stereo cutscenes: the director camera can be rendered in the headset
  instead of on the flat theatre screen, with selectable staged cameras
  per scene. CINEMA remains available.
- Physics Director V2 is enabled by default for CPU headroom, remains
  experimental, and has an exact ORIGINAL/OFF fallback in the Traffic menu.
- Classic/Modern asset categories; no external model pack is included.
- Default quality profile: 100% render scale, sustained CPU/GPU hints,
  Spatial AA, AUTHORED occlusion culling, Modern world textures/weapons and
  Classic vehicles, pedestrians and vegetation when a user-built Modern
  overlay is available. AUTHORED gives substantially better performance but
  remains experimental; use STEREO SAFE or OFF if geometry differs between
  eyes or disappears incorrectly.
- Modern vehicles can be expensive on Quest, especially with high traffic;
  Classic vehicles remain the default and the recommended fallback.
- Pedestrian and vehicle density run from OFF to 300%, opening at 135%
  for pedestrians and 100% for vehicles: a full street is the most
  expensive thing the GPU draws, while the crowd is what carries the
  life of the place. OFF stops new spawns rather than deleting what is
  already on the street.
- Normal frontend/save loading on first launch; the developer Quick Test Start
  shortcut remains available but is off by default.

Multisampling is available as OFF/2X/4X. It smooths the edges the rasteriser
itself creates -- railings, poles, wires -- and deliberately leaves masks to
the mip chain: alpha to coverage was tried on top of it and turned every
leaf and neon tube into a dither lattice.

Experimental temporal AA, SGSR and runtime-only foveation remain disabled:
headset testing did not establish a safe visual or performance benefit.

Runtime/data layout is documented in
[overlay/docs/QUEST_PORT.md](overlay/docs/QUEST_PORT.md). Optional model mixing
is documented in [overlay/docs/QUEST_MODELSETS.md](overlay/docs/QUEST_MODELSETS.md).

## Install the optional Modern models after the APK

No APK rebuild is needed. Connect and authorize the Quest, then double-click
**`INSTALL_MODERN_MODELS.bat`** (Windows) or run **`./INSTALL_MODERN_MODELS.sh`**
(Linux). Select the folder containing a legal original
GTA Vice City PC installation when asked. That is the only asset input the
player must supply. On Linux, build `tools/modelsets/txdcompress` from source
first: `g++ -O2 -o txdcompress txdcompress.cpp`.

The wizard automatically downloads and verifies the two external packs used by
the tested build, extracts them, builds the per-user `modelsets\modern` overlay,
and installs it on the connected Quest. Expect about 4 GB of downloads and keep
at least 24 GB free for downloads, extraction and the staged build. Interrupted
downloads are retained and resumed. If installation fails after the local build
finishes, run the same BAT again: it detects the completed overlay and retries
only the Quest transfer. Verified downloads and extractions are also reused
instead of being downloaded again. These are the exact external inputs:

- [GTA VC HD + Weapons](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Swe1dVWDnKz8ad51y8L0ihPWVCxmFRYj/view)
- [Mods / Atmosphere](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y9KpKjLSna76bjz1Lf2DzP0G4AnkN_2d/view)

The HD vegetation/LibertyCity pack is deliberately **not** downloaded or used.
The builder also removes matching palm/tree geometry found in the HD base and
generates a manifest that routes those models to the original Classic assets.
No original game data or third-party pack is bundled in this repository, and
the generated overlay must not be redistributed.

Before replacing an existing overlay, the installer validates the complete
build, uploads it through a temporary directory, and verifies the required
files on the headset, including SHA256 checks for the loose wheel model and
texture dictionary. If the bundled builder version changes, the BAT safely
rebuilds the local overlay and atomically replaces the old Quest folder only
after all checks pass. Cached downloads/extractions are reused. A failed
download, build or transfer does not silently replace a working Modern folder.

The following manual PowerShell method remains available for troubleshooting.
Change `$modern` to the actual generated folder on the PC. The `$adb` path is
the default created by `BUILD_AND_INSTALL.bat`; use the matching path if
`-WorkDir` was changed.

```powershell
$adb = "C:\VCVRBuild\.android-sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe"
$modern = "C:\Games\Vice City VR\modelsets\modern"

& $adb devices
& $adb shell am force-stop com.miamivr.quest
& $adb shell mkdir -p /sdcard/Android/data/com.miamivr.quest/files/gamedata/modelsets
& $adb push $modern /sdcard/Android/data/com.miamivr.quest/files/gamedata/modelsets
& $adb shell ls /sdcard/Android/data/com.miamivr.quest/files/gamedata/modelsets/modern/models
& $adb shell ls /sdcard/Android/data/com.miamivr.quest/files/gamedata/modelsets/modern/vegetation_models.txt
```

For troubleshooting, an already generated folder can still be transferred by
running `tools\install-modern-models.ps1 -ModernDir "C:\path\to\modern"`
(Windows) or `tools/install-modern-models.sh --modern-dir /path/to/modern`
(Linux).
The final Quest path must be exactly
`gamedata/modelsets/modern`, never `modern/modern`. Fully restart the game after
copying. The default/recommended Quest mix is Modern world textures and
weapons, with Classic vehicles, pedestrians and vegetation. Other categories
can be changed under `VR MENU > MODEL ASSETS`; every change requires a full
process restart. Modern vehicles are GPU-heavy, particularly with high traffic,
and vegetation is intentionally kept Classic.

## Distribution boundary

Do not upload assembled source trees, APKs, original game files, saves, built
Modern model overlays or signing keys to this repository. Publish only this
build kit. Each player must obtain reVC and the original game separately and
perform the documented build locally.
